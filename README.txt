Voice
-----
Uses the browser's built-in Speech Synthesis. Prefer an **en-GB** voice. For fully offline voice, install a British English voice on the device.

Branding
--------
Your name appears in the header. You can edit it in `app.js` (SETTINGS.authorName).

Exam Bank
---------
The **Unit Exam** is provisional until you supply the official MCQ bank (Word doc). I will replace it verbatim with shuffled choices.
